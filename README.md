# landing-page-3

Static HTML &amp; CSS Landing page modeled on the home page of the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Why I chose this

I really like the dark and purple theme of this app's home page. This landing page has an elegant structure that I wanted to emulate for additional practice with static HTML and CSS. I'm not affiliated with the app at all so I wanted to link it for credit but I won't be copying everything about it, just the vibe. There is also some interesting complex interactivity in some of the subsectios of this page that I will not be emulating at this stage - just focusing on layout.
