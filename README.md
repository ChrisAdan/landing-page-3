## What is Onyx?

Onyx is a sleek, modern, privacy-first note taking app that helps you polish your raw creativity into a diamond sheen. Feature-rich and highly customizable, Onyx can help you innovate, brainstorm, connect, publish, share, and interact with your own imagination as well as the contributions of other Onyx users participating in our vibrant online community. With Onyx, you retain exclusive ownership of your data and precision control over your security. Your notes, files, and documents are stored on your devices, and whenever you choose to leave Onyx, you take your data with you. The Onyx mission is to help you realize your best self, and we implement that by offering a robust feature set, simple mechanisms to expand on and extend your custom Onyx experience, and the freedom to create, transform, update, and delete your ideas at home and on the go with our mobile app. Happy creating!

## Why I chose this

Obviously, Onyx does not exist. But for this practice, I really like the dark and purple theme of the Obsidian app's home page, and I like the business model. Their landing page has an elegant structure that I wanted to emulate for additional practice with static HTML and CSS. I'm not affiliated with the app at all so I wanted to link it for credit, but I worked hard to write nearly all of my own copy. There is also some interesting complex interactivity in some of the subsections of this page that I will not be emulating at this stage - just focusing on layout. There are some hover transition effects for links. Also, the app is called Obsidian, but I'll call it Onyx instead.
